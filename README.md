# Mandelbrot
A implementation of the Mandelbrot set, which you can zoom and view in real-time. Designed with Java+videogame lib Slick2D.

This is a Eclipse project, so you should be able to import it directly into eclipse. Also, it used the Slick2D dependencies to draw and get the mouse event. 

The current implementation has a little perfomance problem which can be seen when you try to interact with the game (mouse is so slow). The solution is sketched in the issues.
